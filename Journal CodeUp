Today is the last day of SQL tools section, since the previous post we've covered more
of the relationship types of joins, subqueries, and now we started creating our own temporary
tables. Lastly today we are covering Case Statements for class using COUNT and subqueries within
the case statements themselves. After this lesson today we'll be covering all of the lessons learned
through the quiz the next day on the 30th this month!
